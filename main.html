        The Great War Project (GWP) started in late 2013 to help support community efforts to mark the centenary of the First World War. Our work covers the town of Malmesbury and the surrounding villages in north-west Wiltshire.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to bring people together through events and projects looking at the experiences of communities before, during, and after the First World War. We're not just looking at their loss and sacrifice but also the world they lived in and the lives they led.

      <h1>Community projects</h1>
      <p>
        We've organised several opportunities for leaders of community projects to get together, share ideas, and coordinate their schedules to avoid conflicts. We've put together several displays that have been hosted in the area, including Malmesbury library, to promote what's happening and share stories about this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've also set up and provided moderators for a Facebook group since 2014. This is a space where members of the community can share information about what's happening across our area.

      <h1>Project support</h1>
      <p>
        If you're planning an event, we can help. We can give advice on how to promote your project, provide a free website to showcase your work, and have a wide range of contacts in the community who might be able to help with resources and information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can give advice about where to access free resources and how they can be used - for example the excellent images (including recruitment posters) available for non-commercial use from the Imperial War Museum. We also have a very limited pot of money available which can help with the costs of getting a project up and running. Just get in touch if you'd like to know more.
